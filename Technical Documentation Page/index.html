                <h4>One Stop Bike Shop</h4>

                <p>The name of the company will be "One Stop”. We came up with the bike shop business idea due to the
                    pandemic.
                    Since the start of the pandemic, many people started buying bikes due to the lack of public
                    transportation.
                    It is also one of the new trend hobbies of many people. This caused a great rise in the demand for
                    bike parts and bike services.
                </p>

                <p> The goal of our business is to be the same as its name. We
                    aim to be a one stop shop where the bikers can get their bike
                    parts and services regardless of their available budget. We
                    will offer services and products to our normal bikers, everyday
                    workers, and even professional athletes. Our business offers
                    fully built bikes for the use of everyone, different bike
                    equipment’
                    s for the safety and efficiency of our riders, and
                    Bike parts are also available in case of upgrades or
                    replacement. We also offer maintenance and repair services
                    to ensure the functionality and durability of the bikes.

                <h4>MEMBERSHIPS</h4>

                <p>Study shows that memberships are the new loyalty in retail
                    these days, statistically, people will tend to buy with the
                    shops they have memberships in (i.e. Landers, S&R, etc.)
                    <code>47%</code> of the survey ants say that they would pay more for
                    enhanced benefits rather than shopping and buying in
                    other non-membership stores for free. Although our
                    membership would not be mandatory in buying at our store,
                    you would get exclusive access to promos, products, and
                    services like the points system that we would offer.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>TRADE IN SERVICE</h4>

                <p>Trade in services are being planned to be offered
                    at our store. Since it would widen the selection to
                    cheaper second hand products, and could also
                    attract customers who might want to upgrade
                    with an added discount for their leftover parts.
                    Statistically speaking about <code>80%</code> of consumers get
                    attracted and buy discounted prices. And that is
                    exactly what we are going to offer here. Discounts
                    for their purchases in exchange for parts.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>ONLINE PLATFORM</h4>

                <p>We also plan on establishing an online platform to sell our products, like Shopee or Lazada.
                    About <code>85%</code> of the earth'
                    s population has been buying online since the start of the pandemic
                    and that number grows each year. So here are some ways an online platform could be
                    beneficial to our business,
                </p>

                <p>First is we establish a new way of selling our products, it is much convenient for the customer
                    to shop online rather than coming in the house. the second way is we expand our market. Thru
                    an online platform, we could reach people nationwide as supposed to the people in the vicinity
                    of our shop, therefore increasing our target demographic which is bikers. And last but not least
                    is that in an online platform, store hours don
                    't matter. They can shop in the middle of the night
                    and place their order. Then we would package and send it to them during store hours.

                <h4>Ways of Selling</h4>
                <p>We are a retail/reselling establishment and we plan
                    on selling our product using two main ways. The
                    “traditional”
                    way and the modern way also known as
                    online selling. The
                    “traditional”
                    way of selling products
                    is to sell it in store, whilst the online way of selling is
                    thru shopee or lazada. We have talked about these
                    strategies in our previous section of the business plan
                    which is the marketing plan so this would be just a
                    short summary.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Online Platform</h4>
                <p>We plan on selling our products thru shopping sites (i.e. Lazada, Shopee,
                    etc.). to add to this if the budget for said online platforms get bigger, the
                    next step that we are eying is to create our own website for the
                    consumer to browse
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Sales Strategy</h4>
                <p>We expect to reach <code>450,000 pesos</code> in sales
                    per month, but the amount that we would
                    need to breakeven is about <code>375,000 pesos</code>.
                    This is of course the situation if we sell our all
                    of our stock. To see the computation on how
                    we have reached this amount please refer to
                    the Marketing Plan Section, specifically the
                    Pricing, Positioning, Branding part of said
                    plan

            <div>
                <h4>Funding</h4>
                <p>The initial that we need based on our
                    projection is about <code>289,000 pesos.</code> That is for the initial stock
                    of the shop which would cost about <code>250,000 pesos</code>, for 2
                    minimum wage employees that is <code>24,000 pesos</code> monthly,
                    rent which would cost <code>10,000 pesos</code> and utilities that would
                    cost roughly <code>5,000 pesos</code>.
                    Since this business would be based on the partnership of 5
                    people. We plan on raising this amount thru splitting it 6
                    ways, in which the amount per partner would be around
                    <code>48,200 pesos</code>. Their means of acquiring said money would
                    be of their own choice. The then acquired money would be
                    our capital for the business.
